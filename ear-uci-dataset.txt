*---------------------------------------*

Audio dataset used to train the audio classification model used in the EAR-UCI project.


This dataset is comprised of audio samples from the following public datasets:
    ESC-50          (glass breaking, other)
    UrbanSound8K    (gunshot, other)
    FSD50K          (screaming, other)


All sound samples are in ./audio and spectrograms generated from the samples are found in ./spectrograms


There are four sample categories:

    [Name]          |  [ID] |
    ----------------|-------|
    Other           |   0   |
    Glass Breaking  |   1   |
    Gunshot         |   2   |
    Screaming       |   3   |
   

Note: The "Other" samples were randomly selected audio samples from any of the other categories included in the ESC-50 dataset.


Dataset is split into 10 folds (fold1-9 for training and fold10 for validation).
Each fold contains 4 samples from each category (16 WAV files per fold).


Each sample is named as follows: {sample_id}-{fold}-{category_id}.wav
    {sample_id}:    Overall audio sample number. Sample ID is unique to each sound file.
    {fold}:         Fold number. Corresponds to the fold number the sample belongs to.
    {category_id}:  Number which corresponds to one of the four categories.
